# ⚽ 1v1 Football Game – Web-Based Soccer Showdown

**🚀 Project Overview**

The 1v1 Football Game is a fast-paced, browser-based soccer game built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It features a dynamic player-vs-AI or player-vs-player experience, with interactive gameplay, real-time ball physics, AI difficulty settings, and special power shots.

This project was designed to combine fun game mechanics with solid JavaScript fundamentals, making it both a learning experience and a playable arcade-style game.

**🎮 Features**

**🧨 Power Shot Mechanic**

Press Space to activate a Power Shot when near the ball.

It temporarily boosts the ball’s speed for a powerful strike.

Includes a cooldown system (3 seconds) to prevent spam.

**🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multiplayer Mode (1v1)**

Toggle between:

Multiplayer Mode – Player 1 (WASD) vs Player 2 (Arrow Keys)

Great for couch competition or local co-op!

**🏆 Scoring System**

Each player’s goals are tracked and displayed.

First to reach a score limit (or play unlimited) – goal celebration and auto-reset.

**🟢 Smooth Ball Physics**

The ball moves with realistic inertia.

Bounces off players, walls, and updates position continuously.

Speed reduces over time, mimicking real-world deceleration.

**💬 Why I Built This**

"I wanted to create a fun and interactive game that showcases my understanding of core JavaScript concepts like collision detection, object movement, event handling, and game loops. This football game also allowed me to dive into AI behavior, custom mechanics like power shots, and toggleable multiplayer support."
