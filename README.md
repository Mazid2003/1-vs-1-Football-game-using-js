# ⚽ 1v1 Football Game – Web-Based Soccer Showdown

**🚀 Project Overview**

The 1v1 Football Game is a fast-paced, browser-based soccer game built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It features a dynamic player-vs-AI or player-vs-player experience, with interactive gameplay, real-time ball physics, AI difficulty settings, and special power shots.
